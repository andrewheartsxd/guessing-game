    <p><b>How to Play:</b>
    Player One rolls as many times as s/he wants by clicking the "Player One Rolls" button. Rolling a 7 or an 11 scores a point. Rolling snake eyes (one pip on each die) subtracts a point. After Player One decides to stop rolling, Player Two then rolls the same number of times as Player One. After both players have the same number of rolls, their scores are compared and a payout is calculated.
