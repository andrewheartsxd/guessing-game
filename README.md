### Lily and Andrew's Project 1: JS + HTML.

We started with Andrew's dice guessing game, which was initially built using a series of input and alert boxes.

To integrate JS and HTML, we decided we wanted to show a running balance and roll count on the page, as well as each dice roll in the form of die images on the page.

We accomplished this by keeping the running balance and roll count in the HTML file. Each of the roll buttons are then attached to functions which roll the dice using a random number generator, pulls the prior balance and roll count from the HTML file as variables, adds to the prior balance and roll count depending on the result of the dice roll, and places the updated balance and roll count back in the HTML page. The dice images on the screen also update, depending on the number rolled.

Overall, the initial game design, logic, and HTML file, were set up by Andrew. Lily, with input from Andrew, then greatly refined the JavaScript by creating functions in JavaScript that moved the game from alert and input box based towards a linked system that stored the balance and roll count in HTML and performed the actual roll and calculations in JavaScript. Lily also improved the HTML layout significantly. Andrew then provided the image updating function, as well as the reset button function.
